# Packages the pre-built dx web bundle into a slim runtime image. The build
# itself happens OUTSIDE Docker in CI so cargo/wasm caching works and the
# runtime image stays tiny. The host never compiles anything.

# Build the bundle first (CI does this):  dx bundle --web --release
# Migrations (sqlx::migrate!) and docs are embedded into the server binary at
# compile time, so the runtime image ships neither.
